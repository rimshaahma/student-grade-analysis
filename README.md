This project is part of my Machine Learning Internship at EziTech. The task involves analyzing student grades using Pandas and NumPy. The objectives are:

Create a DataFrame with student scores in three subjects (Math, Science, English).
Calculate the average score for each student.
Assign grades based on the average:
A: Average >= 90
B: 80 <= Average < 90
C: 70 <= Average < 80
D: Below 70
Tools Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Jupyter Notebook
The project notebook is available in this repository, along with the .py script and final CSV report.
