# Student Grades Analysis

This project was developed as part of my Machine Learning internship at EziTech, where the goal is to analyze student grades across multiple subjects. The project involves processing data with Pandas and NumPy to calculate averages and assign grades based on student performance.

## Objectives:
- Create a DataFrame containing student scores for three subjects: Math, Science, and English.
- Calculate the average score for each student.
- Assign letter grades based on the average score:
  - **A**: Average ≥ 90
  - **B**: 80 ≤ Average < 90
  - **C**: 70 ≤ Average < 80
  - **D**: Below 70

## Tools Used:
- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **Pandas**: For handling and processing the data.
- **NumPy**: For numerical calculations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive analysis and visualization.

## Project Structure:
- `student_grades.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the project code and analysis.
- `grades_analysis.py`: Python script that performs the same analysis as in the notebook.
- `final_report.csv`: CSV file containing the final results with student names, scores, average, and grades.

## How to Run the Project:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-grades-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd student-grades-analysis
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook or run the Python script to analyze the data:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook student_grades.ipynb
   ```

## Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how to process and analyze student performance data, calculate averages, and assign grades. It showcases basic data manipulation techniques using Pandas and NumPy.
